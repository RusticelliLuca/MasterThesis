## Abstract
*The purpose of this thesis is to present a new financial derivative which permits to hedge
risk linked to energy and EU Allowances prices increase.
The proposed financial instrument is a swing contract, heavily utilized in the commodity
sector, where the underlying option is a Quanto, therefore it is based on two assets that are
the Italian Unitary Energy (PUN) and the EU Allowances prices.
The valuation problem is analyzed both from a theoretical and practical point of view,
for which a Least Squares approach is applied to Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the
final price. The possible outcome is investigated both through parameters modification and
utilizing a scenario-based approach. These procedures permit to conclude that the derivative
isn’t useful in situation of low price level for one of the two assets, while it brings a cost
saving in case of combined higher prices.*

## Summary
In the folder **Codes** are present the codes related to the last part of the work, where the paramethers linked to the Italian Unitary Energy (PUN) and the EU Allowances prices are utilized in order to simulate 1000 different paths through Monte Carlo simulation. Then, the simulated path are utilized to estimate the price of the Swing Contract on a Quanto Option (2 underlyings) following the Longstaff and Schwartz estimation method. The scenario-based approach is also presented.
